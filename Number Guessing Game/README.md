# A NUMBER GUESSING GAME IN C
<br>

## What is this?
- A number guessing game, written in C that runs on the commandline.
- My first official programming project :)
- My first public project on Github.

<br>

## What it does?
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100 (both included).
- Asks for the difficulty selection.
- Gives a particular number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- Handles (almost) all invalid input by the user.
- Tells the user if the entered number is smaller or larger than the actual number.
- Asks the user if they wanna play again.

<br>

## What I learned from this project?
- Generating random numbers in C.
- How computers generate (pseudo) random numbers.  
- Hanling invalid inputs via scanf.
- Refactoring the code into multiple, managable pieces.

<br>

## Potential Bugs:
- The game will mark it as a 'lost game' if the correct number is guessed at the very last attempt.
